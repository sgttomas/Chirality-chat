## 🔍 Understanding Document Injection

### How RAG Works in Chirality Chat

When you chat, the system automatically:

1. **Detects available documents** (DS, SP, X, M)
2. **Compacts document content** for efficient AI context
3. **Injects into system prompt** before sending to OpenAI
4. **Provides context-aware responses** using your generated documents

### Monitoring Document Usage

**In Admin Dashboard:**
- View exact system instructions sent to AI
- See which documents are injected
- Monitor token usage and optimization
- Validate successful document integration

**In Chat Interface:**
- Responses reference your generated documents
- AI provides citations and connections
- Context-aware answers to domain-specific questions

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

- **Follow with SP**: Establish procedures and workflows
- **Use X for solutions**: Create narrative frameworks
- **Finish with M**: Document justifications and guidance

### Chat Optimization
- **Ask specific questions**: Reference document types directly
- **Request comparisons**: "Compare the DS and SP approaches"
- **Seek elaboration**: "Expand on step 3 from the SP document"
- **Test understanding**: "Summarize the key risks from document M"

### Admin Dashboard Usage
